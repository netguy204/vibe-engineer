summary: 'FEEDBACK: Add `ve orch tail <chunk>` command to stream log output for orchestrator
  work units with `-f` follow mode'
operator_review: good

## Assessment

The implementation is comprehensive and well-structured:
- Log parser module (`src/orchestrator/log_parser.py`) correctly parses all message types
- CLI command handles basic tail, phase headers, result banners
- Error handling for missing chunks and missing logs is appropriate
- Follow mode with 100ms polling and phase transition detection is implemented
- All 1998 tests pass, including 38 new tests for this feature
- Code backreference comment is present as planned

However, the PLAN.md Step 7 explicitly specified tests for follow mode:
- `test_tail_follow_mode_detects_new_lines`
- `test_tail_follow_mode_phase_transition`

These tests were not implemented, leaving follow mode untested.

## Decision Rationale

The success criterion explicitly states "Tests cover basic tail, follow mode, phase transitions, and message parsing." While basic tail, phase transitions (in basic mode), and message parsing are tested, follow mode (the `-f` flag behavior) lacks test coverage. This is a functional gap - the tests outlined in the plan were not written.

This is a clear, fixable gap with obvious corrections needed. I'm confident the tests should be added.

## Context

- Goal: Add `ve orch tail <chunk>` command to stream log output for orchestrator work units with `-f` follow mode
- Linked artifacts: orchestrator subsystem (uses)
