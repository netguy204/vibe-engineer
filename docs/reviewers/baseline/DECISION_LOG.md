## orch_plan_merge_conflict - 2026-01-31 21:45

**Mode:** final
**Iteration:** 1
**Decision:** APPROVE

### Context Summary
- Goal: Add explicit prompting guidance for agents to commit both GOAL.md and PLAN.md when committing a new chunk before injection, preventing merge conflicts during orchestrator worktree operations.
- Linked artifacts: Friction entry F016 (referenced but not present in FRICTION.md)

### Assessment
The implementation adds commit guidance in two strategic locations:
1. **chunk-create skill (Step 9)**: Explicit instructions with `git add docs/chunks/<shortname>/` command and explanation of why partial commits cause "untracked working tree files would be overwritten" merge failures.
2. **GOAL.md template**: A concise "COMMIT BOTH FILES" paragraph in the FUTURE CHUNK APPROVAL REQUIREMENT section, serving as a reminder when agents edit GOAL.md.

The changes correctly navigate DEC-005 ("Commands do not prescribe git operations") by documenting what files belong together without prescribing when to commit. All 1960 tests pass.

One minor issue: The GOAL.md references friction entry F016, but this entry doesn't exist in FRICTION.md (highest is F014). This is a metadata inconsistency that should be addressed during chunk completion.

### Decision Rationale
All four success criteria are satisfied:
- Both locations (skill and template) contain explicit commit guidance
- The guidance explains the problem and provides the solution command
- Tests pass with no regressions
- DEC-005 compliance is maintained

The implementation serves the spirit of the goal by addressing the root cause (agents not knowing to commit both files) through prompting improvements rather than code changes.

- [x] Good example (incorporate into future reviews)
- [ ] Bad example (avoid this pattern)
- [ ] Feedback: Minor metadata issue (F016 reference) noted but doesn't affect approval

## orch_tail_command - 2026-01-31 16:30

**Mode:** final
**Iteration:** 1
**Decision:** FEEDBACK

### Context Summary
- Goal: Add `ve orch tail <chunk>` command to stream log output for orchestrator work units with `-f` follow mode
- Linked artifacts: orchestrator subsystem (uses)

### Assessment

The implementation is comprehensive and well-structured:
- Log parser module (`src/orchestrator/log_parser.py`) correctly parses all message types
- CLI command handles basic tail, phase headers, result banners
- Error handling for missing chunks and missing logs is appropriate
- Follow mode with 100ms polling and phase transition detection is implemented
- All 1998 tests pass, including 38 new tests for this feature
- Code backreference comment is present as planned

However, the PLAN.md Step 7 explicitly specified tests for follow mode:
- `test_tail_follow_mode_detects_new_lines`
- `test_tail_follow_mode_phase_transition`

These tests were not implemented, leaving follow mode untested.

### Decision Rationale

The success criterion explicitly states "Tests cover basic tail, follow mode, phase transitions, and message parsing." While basic tail, phase transitions (in basic mode), and message parsing are tested, follow mode (the `-f` flag behavior) lacks test coverage. This is a functional gap - the tests outlined in the plan were not written.

This is a clear, fixable gap with obvious corrections needed. I'm confident the tests should be added.
