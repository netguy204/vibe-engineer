# Article Writing Workflow

<!--
TEMPLATE INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Copy this file to the articles area: docs/articles/{name}_workflow.md
2. Fill in the Article Metadata section
3. Work iteratively through the activities - this is not a waterfall process
4. The agent and human collaborate throughout; ownership shifts by activity

## How This Workflow Works

This is an **iterative** process, not sequential phases. Expect to loop through these activities multiple times:

1. **Outlining** - Agent proposes structure, human adds voice inline
2. **Drafting** - Agent assembles prose, human edits for voice
3. **Restructuring** - Either party identifies flow problems; agent presents options, human chooses
4. **Polishing** - Final pass for grammar and clarity

**The collaboration pattern:** When the agent needs to make structural decisions (reordering, cutting, merging), present 2-3 options with trade-offs. Let the human choose. Do not make unilateral changes to structure or voice.

## Outline with Voice Notes

<!--
Agent: Create the initial outline with beats. Each beat should be specific enough
to prompt 1-3 sentences of voice capture.
Human: Add your voice notes as blockquotes (>) directly under each beat.
Do not copy beats elsewhere - write inline where you see them.

Format:
## Section Name
### Beat: [specific point]
> Your raw thoughts here. Stream of consciousness is fine.
> Capture the feeling and insight, not just information.
-->

(Agent creates outline; human adds voice notes inline as blockquotes)

## Current Draft

<!--
Agent: Assemble voice notes into flowing prose here.
- Organize into paragraphs
- Add transitions
- Smooth phrasing
- Mark uncertainties with [?] inline
- Do NOT add new ideas
- Do NOT remove ideas even if tangential
-->

(assembled draft goes here)

## Open Questions

<!--
Track uncertainties here instead of a formal table.
These are things to resolve with the human.

## Parking Lot

<!--
Good ideas that were cut for flow but might fit later articles.
Include the original text and a note about where it might belong.
-->

(cut ideas go here)

## Agent Guidelines

### When Outlining
- Create beats specific enough to prompt focused voice capture
- Expect the outline to evolve as voice notes reveal the actual shape

### When Drafting
- Preserve the human's word choices where possible
- Add transitions, do not add arguments
- Mark uncertainties with [?] inline rather than logging them formally

### When Restructuring
- Always present 2-3 options with trade-offs
- Explain what each option gains and loses
- Let the human choose - do not make unilateral structural decisions
- Common restructures: reorder paragraphs, cut sections, merge ideas, move content earlier/later

### When Polishing
- Fix grammar and punctuation
- Improve clarity where possible
- Do NOT change voice or tone
- Flag concerns for human decision rather than resolving them yourself
