<!--
TEMPLATE INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Copy this file to: docs/articles/drafts/article_N_title/WORKFLOW.md
2. Fill in the Article Metadata section
3. Progress through phases sequentially, updating Current Phase as you go
4. Each phase has completion criteria - don't advance until met

## Current Phase

**Phase:** (1-Decomposition | 2-Voice Capture | 3-Assembly | 4-Voice Check | 5-Polish | COMPLETE)

**Status:**

**Next Action:**

---

## Phase 1: Decomposition

**Owner:** Agent
**Goal:** Break the article into granular beats—specific points each section must hit.

### Outline

<!--
Agent: Create a hierarchical outline here. Each beat should be specific enough
that the human can write 1-3 sentences of raw thoughts against it.

Format:
## Section Name
### Beat 1: [specific point]
### Beat 2: [specific point]
-->

(outline goes here)

### Phase 1 Completion Criteria
- [ ] Every section from the article plan is represented
- [ ] Beats are specific enough to prompt focused voice capture
- [ ] Human has reviewed and approved the outline structure

### Phase 1 Notes

(agent notes on outline decisions, human feedback on structure)

---

## Phase 2: Voice Capture

**Owner:** Human
**Goal:** Annotate each beat with freeform thoughts in your authentic voice.

### Instructions for Human

For each beat in the outline above, write your raw thoughts:
- Stream of consciousness is fine
- Don't worry about polish or transitions
- Capture the *feeling* and *insight*, not just the information
- If a beat doesn't resonate, note that—we can restructure

### Voice Capture Content

<!--
Human: Copy each beat header and write your thoughts beneath it.
Keep your annotations clearly separated from the outline.

Format:
### Beat 1: [specific point]
**Voice notes:** [your freeform thoughts here]
-->

(voice capture goes here)

### Phase 2 Completion Criteria
- [ ] Every beat has voice notes (or explicit "skip/restructure" note)
- [ ] Human feels the raw material captures their perspective
- [ ] Any structural concerns have been flagged

### Phase 2 Notes

(human notes on what felt natural vs forced, structural concerns)

---

## Phase 3: Assembly

**Owner:** Agent
**Goal:** Stitch voice notes into coherent paragraphs without adding ideas.

### Assembly Guidelines

The agent will:
1. Organize voice notes into flowing paragraphs
2. Add transitions between ideas
3. Smooth rough edges in phrasing
4. Flag uncertainties with `[UNCERTAIN: reason]` markers
5. NOT add new ideas, arguments, or examples
6. NOT remove ideas even if they seem tangential

### Assembled Draft

<!--
Agent: Write the assembled draft here. Use [UNCERTAIN: ...] markers
where you've inferred connections or where notes were ambiguous.
-->

(assembled draft goes here)

### Uncertainty Log

| Location | Uncertainty | Resolution |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| | | |

### Phase 3 Completion Criteria
- [ ] All voice notes have been incorporated
- [ ] Uncertainties are flagged, not papered over
- [ ] Draft flows as a coherent piece
- [ ] No new ideas have been introduced

### Phase 3 Notes

(agent notes on assembly decisions, inferences made)

---

## Phase 4: Voice Check

**Owner:** Human
**Goal:** Revise anything that doesn't sound like you.

### Instructions for Human

Read the assembled draft and:
1. Mark passages that don't sound like your voice
2. Rewrite those passages in your words
3. Resolve any `[UNCERTAIN]` markers
4. Note patterns for future workflow improvement

### Voice Check Edits

<!--
Human: Either edit the assembled draft directly (above) or note edits here.
If editing directly, use ~~strikethrough~~ for removed text and **bold** for additions.
-->

(edits and revisions go here)

### Phase 4 Completion Criteria
- [ ] Human has read the full draft
- [ ] All `[UNCERTAIN]` markers are resolved
- [ ] Human confirms the draft sounds like them
- [ ] Patterns noted for workflow improvement (if any)

### Phase 4 Notes

(human notes on voice drift patterns, workflow improvements needed)

---

## Phase 5: Polish

**Owner:** Agent
**Goal:** Final pass for clarity, grammar, and flow.

### Polish Guidelines

The agent will:
1. Fix grammar and punctuation
2. Improve sentence clarity where possible
3. Smooth any remaining rough transitions
4. Check for consistency in terminology
5. NOT change voice or tone
6. Flag any remaining concerns for human decision

### Polished Draft

<!--
Agent: Write the final polished version here.
This becomes the publication-ready draft pending human approval.
-->

(polished draft goes here)

### Polish Log

| Change | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|
| | |

### Phase 5 Completion Criteria
- [ ] Grammar and punctuation are correct
- [ ] Transitions flow smoothly
- [ ] No voice/tone changes introduced
- [ ] Human has approved final draft

### Phase 5 Notes

(agent notes on polish decisions)
