# Chunks: The Assignment That Becomes the Record

## Beat Outline

### The Struggle: Scoped Assignments Already Exist

#### Beat 1: Plan mode / Cursor already solved scoping
>

#### Beat 2: But when the session ends, reasoning evaporates
>

#### Beat 3: The next agent sees code but not *why*
>

#### Beat 4: You explain the same context again. And again.
>

### The Insight: Assignment = Documentation

#### Beat 5: The chunk is both assignment AND medical record
>

#### Beat 6: Same artifact serves both purposes
>

#### Beat 7: Writing the GOAL.md to assign work IS writing documentation
>

#### Beat 8: No extra cost—you were going to scope the work anyway
>

### The Resolution: Compounding Wiki

#### Beat 9: Every chunk is a page in your onboarding wiki
>

#### Beat 10: You never have to explain that particular assignment again
>

#### Beat 11: Future agents discover chunks through code backreferences
>

#### Beat 12: One-time effort compounds into institutional memory
>

### The Key Tension Resolved

#### Beat 13: "Documentation feels like overhead" → "The assignment IS the documentation"
>

### Theme Connections (weave throughout, don't make explicit)

- **Amnesiac surgeon** — the chunk externalizes memory that would otherwise be lost
- **Discoverable documentation** — code links back to chunks; agents explore reasoning from anywhere
- **Compounding judgment** — chunks accumulate into a wiki that gets smarter over time
