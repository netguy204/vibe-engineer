# Multi-Project Task

You're in a **task directory** coordinating work across multiple repositories.

## Projects

| Role | Repository |
|------|------------|
| **External Artifacts** | `{{external_artifact_repo}}` |
{{#projects}}
| Participating | `{{.}}` |
{{/projects}}

Workflow artifacts (chunks, narratives, subsystems, investigations) live in the external repo. Implementation happens in participating projects.

## Commands

All commands work from task root. You can also `cd` into a project for project-specific work.

**Artifact commands:** `/chunk-create`, `/chunk-plan`, `/chunk-implement`, `/chunk-complete`

**Other artifacts:** `/narrative-create`, `/subsystem-discover`, `/investigation-create`

Run `ve chunk list` to see task-level chunks. Use `/help` for detailed command guidance.

## Backreferences

When implementing, add backreferences to the **project-local** path:
```python
# Chunk: docs/chunks/{{chunk_name}}
```

This points to the project's external.yaml, which resolves to the external repo.
