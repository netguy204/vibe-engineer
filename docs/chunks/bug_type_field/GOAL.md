This comment describes schema information that needs to be adhered
to throughout the process.

STATUS VALUES:
- FUTURE: This chunk is queued for future work and not yet being implemented
- IMPLEMENTING: This chunk is in the process of being implemented.
- ACTIVE: This chunk accurately describes current or recently-merged work
- SUPERSEDED: Another chunk has modified the code this chunk governed
- HISTORICAL: Significant drift; kept for archaeology only

BACKGROUND WORKFLOW NOTE:
When a FUTURE chunk is created via the "background" keyword (operator says "in the background"),
you MUST present the GOAL.md to the operator for review before committing or injecting.
The background keyword indicates work should be queued, not that it's pre-approved.

PARENT_CHUNK:
- null for new work
- chunk directory name (e.g., "006-segment-compaction") for corrections or modifications

CODE_PATHS:
- Populated at planning time
- List files you expect to create or modify
- Example: ["src/segment/writer.rs", "src/segment/format.rs"]

CODE_REFERENCES:
- Populated after implementation, before PR
- Uses symbolic references to identify code locations

- Format: {file_path}#{symbol_path} where symbol_path uses :: as nesting separator
- Example:
  code_references:
    - ref: src/segment/writer.rs#SegmentWriter
      implements: "Core write loop and buffer management"
    - ref: src/segment/writer.rs#SegmentWriter::fsync
      implements: "Durability guarantees"
    - ref: src/utils.py#validate_input
      implements: "Input validation logic"


NARRATIVE:
- If this chunk was derived from a narrative document, reference the narrative directory name.
- When setting this field during /chunk-create, also update the narrative's OVERVIEW.md
  frontmatter to add this chunk to its `chunks` array with the prompt and chunk_directory.
- If this is the final chunk of a narrative, the narrative status should be set to completed
  when this chunk is completed.

INVESTIGATION:
- If this chunk was derived from an investigation's proposed_chunks, reference the investigation
  directory name (e.g., "memory_leak" for docs/investigations/memory_leak/).
- This provides traceability from implementation work back to exploratory findings.
- When implementing, read the referenced investigation's OVERVIEW.md for context on findings,
  hypotheses tested, and decisions made during exploration.
- Validated by `ve chunk validate` to ensure referenced investigations exist.

SUBSYSTEMS:
- Optional list of subsystem references that this chunk relates to
- Format: subsystem_id is {NNNN}-{short_name}, relationship is "implements" or "uses"
- "implements": This chunk directly implements part of the subsystem's functionality
- "uses": This chunk depends on or uses the subsystem's functionality
- Example:
  subsystems:
    - subsystem_id: "0001-validation"
      relationship: implements
    - subsystem_id: "0002-frontmatter"
      relationship: uses
- Validated by `ve chunk validate` to ensure referenced subsystems exist
- When a chunk that implements a subsystem is completed, a reference should be added to
  that chunk in the subsystems OVERVIEW.md file front matter and relevant section.

FRICTION_ENTRIES:
- Optional list of friction entries that this chunk addresses
- Provides "why did we do this work?" traceability from implementation back to accumulated pain points
- Format: entry_id is the friction entry ID (e.g., "F001"), scope is "full" or "partial"
  - "full": This chunk fully resolves the friction entry
  - "partial": This chunk partially addresses the friction entry
- When to populate: During /chunk-create if this chunk addresses known friction from FRICTION.md
- Example:
  friction_entries:
    - entry_id: F001
      scope: full
    - entry_id: F003
      scope: partial
- Validated by `ve chunk validate` to ensure referenced friction entries exist in FRICTION.md
- When a chunk addresses friction entries and is completed, those entries are considered RESOLVED

CHUNK ARTIFACTS:
- Single-use scripts, migration tools, or one-time utilities created for this chunk
  should be stored in the chunk directory (e.g., docs/chunks/0042-foo/migrate.py)
- These artifacts help future archaeologists understand what the chunk did
- Unlike code in src/, chunk artifacts are not expected to be maintained long-term
- Examples: data migration scripts, one-time fixups, analysis tools used during implementation


CREATED_AFTER:
- Auto-populated by `ve chunk create` - DO NOT MODIFY manually
- Lists the "tips" of the chunk DAG at creation time (chunks with no dependents yet)
- Tips must be ACTIVE chunks (shipped work that has been merged)
- Example: created_after: ["auth_refactor", "api_cleanup"]

IMPORTANT - created_after is NOT implementation dependencies:
- created_after tracks CAUSAL ORDERING (what work existed when this chunk was created)
- It does NOT mean "chunks that must be implemented before this one can work"
- FUTURE chunks can NEVER be tips (they haven't shipped yet)

COMMON MISTAKE: Setting created_after to reference FUTURE chunks because they
represent design dependencies. This is WRONG. If chunk B conceptually depends on
chunk A's implementation, but A is still FUTURE, B's created_after should still
reference the current ACTIVE tips, not A.

WHERE TO TRACK IMPLEMENTATION DEPENDENCIES:
- Investigation proposed_chunks ordering (earlier = implement first)
- Narrative chunk sequencing in OVERVIEW.md
- Design documents describing the intended build order
- The `created_after` field will naturally reflect this once chunks ship

# Chunk Goal

## Minor Goal

Add a `bug_type` field to the chunk schema that guides agent behavior at completion time. When a chunk is a bug fix, the agent should classify it as either:

- **`semantic`**: The bug revealed new understanding of intended behavior. This is a discovery—we learned something about how the system should work.
- **`implementation`**: The bug corrected known-wrong code. We knew how it should work; we just built it wrong.

The chunk template should include conditional guidance based on this classification:
- **Semantic bugs** require code backreferences (the fix adds to code understanding) and should search for other chunks that may need updating based on the new understanding. On completion, status → ACTIVE (the chunk asserts ongoing understanding).
- **Implementation bugs** may skip backreferences (they don't add semantic value) and focus purely on the fix. On completion, status → HISTORICAL (point-in-time correction, not an ongoing anchor).

**Context from investigation:** Analysis of existing bug chunks showed that semantic value varies by type. Pure code bugs (typos, null handling) provide low semantic value via backreferences, while bugs that reveal workflow or clarity issues provide high value. This field enables the agent to behave appropriately based on the bug's nature.

## Success Criteria

1. **Schema addition**: `bug_type` field added to chunk frontmatter schema with values `semantic` | `implementation` | `null` (for non-bug chunks)
2. **Template guidance**: Chunk GOAL.md template includes conditional instructions based on bug_type value
3. **Semantic bug guidance**: Template instructs agents to add code backreferences and search for impacted chunks when `bug_type: semantic`
4. **Implementation bug guidance**: Template allows agents to skip backreferences when `bug_type: implementation`, noting they don't add code understanding
5. **Status transition guidance**: Template instructs that on completion, `semantic` bugs → ACTIVE status (ongoing anchor), `implementation` bugs → HISTORICAL status (point-in-time)
6. **Agent prompting**: `/chunk-create` skill prompts agents to classify bug type when creating a bug fix chunk
7. **Validation**: `ve chunk validate` accepts the new field values
8. **Tests**: Unit tests verify schema accepts valid bug_type values

## Relationship to Parent

<!--
DELETE THIS SECTION if parent_chunk is null.

If this chunk modifies work from a previous chunk, explain:
- What deficiency or change prompted this work?
- What from the parent chunk remains valid?
- What is being changed and why?

This context helps agents understand the delta and avoid breaking
invariants established by the parent.
