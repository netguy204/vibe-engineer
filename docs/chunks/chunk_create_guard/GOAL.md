This comment describes schema information that needs to be adhered
to throughout the process.

STATUS VALUES:
- FUTURE: This chunk is queued for future work and not yet being implemented
- IMPLEMENTING: This chunk is in the process of being implemented.
- ACTIVE: This chunk accurately describes current or recently-merged work
- SUPERSEDED: Another chunk has modified the code this chunk governed
- HISTORICAL: Significant drift; kept for archaeology only

PARENT_CHUNK:
- null for new work
- chunk directory name (e.g., "006-segment-compaction") for corrections or modifications

CODE_PATHS:
- Populated at planning time
- List files you expect to create or modify
- Example: ["src/segment/writer.rs", "src/segment/format.rs"]

CODE_REFERENCES:
- Populated after implementation, before PR
- Uses symbolic references to identify code locations
- Format: {file_path}#{symbol_path} where symbol_path uses :: as nesting separator
- Example:
  code_references:
    - ref: src/segment/writer.rs#SegmentWriter
      implements: "Core write loop and buffer management"
    - ref: src/segment/writer.rs#SegmentWriter::fsync
      implements: "Durability guarantees"
    - ref: src/utils.py#validate_input
      implements: "Input validation logic"

NARRATIVE:
- If this chunk was derived from a narrative document, reference the narrative directory name.
- When setting this field during /chunk-create, also update the narrative's OVERVIEW.md
  frontmatter to add this chunk to its `chunks` array with the prompt and chunk_directory.
- If this is the final chunk of a narrative, the narrative status should be set to completed 
  when this chunk is completed. 

SUBSYSTEMS:
- Optional list of subsystem references that this chunk relates to
- Format: subsystem_id is {NNNN}-{short_name}, relationship is "implements" or "uses"
- "implements": This chunk directly implements part of the subsystem's functionality
- "uses": This chunk depends on or uses the subsystem's functionality
- Example:
  subsystems:
    - subsystem_id: "0001-validation"
      relationship: implements
    - subsystem_id: "0002-frontmatter"
      relationship: uses
- Validated by `ve chunk validate` to ensure referenced subsystems exist
- When a chunk that implements a subsystem is completed, a reference should be added to
  that chunk in the subsystems OVERVIEW.md file front matter and relevant section.

CHUNK ARTIFACTS:
- Single-use scripts, migration tools, or one-time utilities created for this chunk
  should be stored in the chunk directory (e.g., docs/chunks/0042-foo/migrate.py)
- These artifacts help future archaeologists understand what the chunk did
- Unlike code in src/, chunk artifacts are not expected to be maintained long-term
- Examples: data migration scripts, one-time fixups, analysis tools used during implementation

# Chunk Goal

## Minor Goal

The `ve chunk start` command should fail with a clear error message if there is already a chunk with status `IMPLEMENTING`. This prevents workflow inconsistency where an operator forgets to transition a chunk to `ACTIVE` before starting new work, which would leave multiple chunks in progress and create ambiguity about what work is current.

This supports the workflow invariant that exactly one chunk should be in `IMPLEMENTING` status at any time, ensuring clear ownership of active work.

## Success Criteria

- `ve chunk start <name>` fails with a descriptive error when an `IMPLEMENTING` chunk already exists
- `ve chunk activate <name>` fails with a descriptive error when an `IMPLEMENTING` chunk already exists
- Error messages identify the existing IMPLEMENTING chunk by name/path
- Error messages suggest running `ve chunk complete` first to transition the current work
- The `--future` flag on `ve chunk start` bypasses the check (since FUTURE chunks don't conflict)
- Existing tests continue to pass
- New test cases cover both guard behaviors
