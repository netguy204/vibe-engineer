This comment describes schema information that needs to be adhered
to throughout the process.

STATUS VALUES:
- FUTURE: This chunk is queued for future work and not yet being implemented
- IMPLEMENTING: This chunk is in the process of being implemented.
- ACTIVE: This chunk accurately describes current or recently-merged work
- SUPERSEDED: Another chunk has modified the code this chunk governed
- HISTORICAL: Significant drift; kept for archaeology only

PARENT_CHUNK:
- null for new work
- chunk directory name (e.g., "006-segment-compaction") for corrections or modifications

CODE_PATHS:
- Populated at planning time
- List files you expect to create or modify
- Example: ["src/segment/writer.rs", "src/segment/format.rs"]

CODE_REFERENCES:
- Populated after implementation, before PR
- Uses symbolic references to identify code locations

- Format: {file_path}#{symbol_path} where symbol_path uses :: as nesting separator
- Example:
  code_references:
    - ref: src/segment/writer.rs#SegmentWriter
      implements: "Core write loop and buffer management"
    - ref: src/segment/writer.rs#SegmentWriter::fsync
      implements: "Durability guarantees"
    - ref: src/utils.py#validate_input
      implements: "Input validation logic"


NARRATIVE:
- If this chunk was derived from a narrative document, reference the narrative directory name.
- When setting this field during /chunk-create, also update the narrative's OVERVIEW.md
  frontmatter to add this chunk to its `chunks` array with the prompt and chunk_directory.
- If this is the final chunk of a narrative, the narrative status should be set to completed
  when this chunk is completed.

INVESTIGATION:
- If this chunk was derived from an investigation's proposed_chunks, reference the investigation
  directory name (e.g., "memory_leak" for docs/investigations/memory_leak/).
- This provides traceability from implementation work back to exploratory findings.
- When implementing, read the referenced investigation's OVERVIEW.md for context on findings,
  hypotheses tested, and decisions made during exploration.
- Validated by `ve chunk validate` to ensure referenced investigations exist.

SUBSYSTEMS:
- Optional list of subsystem references that this chunk relates to
- Format: subsystem_id is {NNNN}-{short_name}, relationship is "implements" or "uses"
- "implements": This chunk directly implements part of the subsystem's functionality
- "uses": This chunk depends on or uses the subsystem's functionality
- Example:
  subsystems:
    - subsystem_id: "0001-validation"
      relationship: implements
    - subsystem_id: "0002-frontmatter"
      relationship: uses
- Validated by `ve chunk validate` to ensure referenced subsystems exist
- When a chunk that implements a subsystem is completed, a reference should be added to
  that chunk in the subsystems OVERVIEW.md file front matter and relevant section.

FRICTION_ENTRIES:
- Optional list of friction entries that this chunk addresses
- Provides "why did we do this work?" traceability from implementation back to accumulated pain points
- Format: entry_id is the friction entry ID (e.g., "F001"), scope is "full" or "partial"
  - "full": This chunk fully resolves the friction entry
  - "partial": This chunk partially addresses the friction entry
- When to populate: During /chunk-create if this chunk addresses known friction from FRICTION.md
- Example:
  friction_entries:
    - entry_id: F001
      scope: full
    - entry_id: F003
      scope: partial
- Validated by `ve chunk validate` to ensure referenced friction entries exist in FRICTION.md
- When a chunk addresses friction entries and is completed, those entries are considered RESOLVED

CHUNK ARTIFACTS:
- Single-use scripts, migration tools, or one-time utilities created for this chunk
  should be stored in the chunk directory (e.g., docs/chunks/0042-foo/migrate.py)
- These artifacts help future archaeologists understand what the chunk did
- Unlike code in src/, chunk artifacts are not expected to be maintained long-term
- Examples: data migration scripts, one-time fixups, analysis tools used during implementation

CREATED_AFTER:
- Auto-populated by `ve chunk create` - DO NOT MODIFY manually
- Lists the "tips" of the chunk DAG at creation time (chunks with no dependents yet)
- Tips must be ACTIVE chunks (shipped work that has been merged)
- Example: created_after: ["auth_refactor", "api_cleanup"]

IMPORTANT - created_after is NOT implementation dependencies:
- created_after tracks CAUSAL ORDERING (what work existed when this chunk was created)
- It does NOT mean "chunks that must be implemented before this one can work"
- FUTURE chunks can NEVER be tips (they haven't shipped yet)

COMMON MISTAKE: Setting created_after to reference FUTURE chunks because they
represent design dependencies. This is WRONG. If chunk B conceptually depends on
chunk A's implementation, but A is still FUTURE, B's created_after should still
reference the current ACTIVE tips, not A.

WHERE TO TRACK IMPLEMENTATION DEPENDENCIES:
- Investigation proposed_chunks ordering (earlier = implement first)
- Narrative chunk sequencing in OVERVIEW.md
- Design documents describing the intended build order
- The `created_after` field will naturally reflect this once chunks ship

# Chunk Goal

## Minor Goal

Add a web dashboard to the orchestrator that provides an "at a glance" interface for rapid re-orientation after interruptions. The dashboard enables operators to monitor parallel agent workflows, see what needs attention, and respond to questions without switching to the CLI.

This is Phase 5 of the orchestrator implementation (per `docs/investigations/parallel_agent_orchestration/design.md`). It depends on the attention queue infrastructure from `orch_attention_queue`.

**Technology choices:**
- **FastAPI + Jinja2** for server-rendered HTML (lightweight, consistent with Python codebase)
- **WebSocket** for real-time updates (attention queue changes + work unit status transitions)
- **Basic actions** in UI (answer questions, resolve conflicts) with CLI for advanced operations

## Success Criteria

1. **Dashboard serves at `/` when daemon is running**
   - `ve orch start` spawns the daemon which serves HTTP on a configurable port
   - Root URL shows the orchestrator dashboard
   - Dashboard accessible at `http://localhost:<port>/` (port from config or default)

2. **Real-time attention queue view**
   - WebSocket connection streams attention queue updates
   - New attention items appear without page refresh
   - Resolved items disappear without page refresh
   - Each item shows: type, chunk, downstream impact (blocks:N), time waiting, question/context

3. **Process grid showing work unit status**
   - RUNNING work units with current phase and elapsed time
   - READY work units queued for execution
   - BLOCKED work units with blocking reason visible
   - Status changes stream via WebSocket

4. **Answer questions from the UI**
   - Click on attention item to expand context
   - Text input for free-form answers
   - Option buttons for multiple-choice questions
   - Submit answer triggers `ve orch answer` equivalent

5. **Resolve conflicts from the UI**
   - Conflict items show the two chunks and confidence level
   - Buttons for "Parallelize anyway" vs "Serialize"
   - Submit triggers `ve orch resolve` equivalent

6. **Tests pass**
   - Integration tests for WebSocket connection and message streaming
   - Tests for answer/resolve endpoints
   - Dashboard renders correctly with various queue states
