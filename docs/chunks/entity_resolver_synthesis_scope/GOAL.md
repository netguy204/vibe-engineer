This comment describes schema information that needs to be adhered
to throughout the process.

STATUS VALUES (status answers: how much of the intent does this chunk own?):
- FUTURE: Not yet owned. Queued for later.
- IMPLEMENTING: Being taken into ownership. At most one per worktree.
- ACTIVE: Fully owns the intent that governs the code.
- COMPOSITE: Shares ownership with other chunks. Must be read alongside its co-owners.
- HISTORICAL: No longer owns intent. Kept for archaeological context.

See docs/trunk/CHUNKS.md for the full principle.

FUTURE CHUNK APPROVAL REQUIREMENT:
ALL FUTURE chunks require operator approval before committing or injecting.
After refining this GOAL.md, you MUST present it to the operator and wait for
explicit approval. Do NOT commit or inject until the operator approves.
This applies whether triggered by "in the background", "create a future chunk",
or any other mechanism that creates a FUTURE chunk.

COMMIT BOTH FILES: When committing a FUTURE chunk after approval, add the entire
chunk directory (both GOAL.md and PLAN.md) to the commit, not just GOAL.md. The
`ve chunk create` command creates both files, and leaving PLAN.md untracked will
cause merge conflicts when the orchestrator creates a worktree for the PLAN phase.

PARENT_CHUNK:
- null for new work
- chunk directory name (e.g., "006-segment-compaction") for corrections or modifications

CODE_PATHS:
- Populated at planning time
- List files you expect to create or modify
- Example: ["src/segment/writer.rs", "src/segment/format.rs"]

CODE_REFERENCES:
- Populated after implementation, before PR
- Uses symbolic references to identify code locations

- Format: {file_path}#{symbol_path} where symbol_path uses :: as nesting separator
- Example:
  code_references:
    - ref: src/segment/writer.rs#SegmentWriter
      implements: "Core write loop and buffer management"
    - ref: src/segment/writer.rs#SegmentWriter::fsync
      implements: "Durability guarantees"
    - ref: src/utils.py#validate_input
      implements: "Input validation logic"


NARRATIVE:
- If this chunk was derived from a narrative document, reference the narrative directory name.
- When setting this field during /chunk-create, also update the narrative's OVERVIEW.md
  frontmatter to add this chunk to its `chunks` array with the prompt and chunk_directory.
- If this is the final chunk of a narrative, the narrative status should be set to COMPLETED
  when this chunk is completed.

INVESTIGATION:
- If this chunk was derived from an investigation's proposed_chunks, reference the investigation
  directory name (e.g., "memory_leak" for docs/investigations/memory_leak/).
- This provides traceability from implementation work back to exploratory findings.
- When implementing, read the referenced investigation's OVERVIEW.md for context on findings,
  hypotheses tested, and decisions made during exploration.
- Validated by `ve chunk validate` to ensure referenced investigations exist.


SUBSYSTEMS:
- Optional list of subsystem references that this chunk relates to
- Format: subsystem_id is the subsystem directory name, relationship is "implements" or "uses"
- "implements": This chunk directly implements part of the subsystem's functionality
- "uses": This chunk depends on or uses the subsystem's functionality
- Example:
  subsystems:
    - subsystem_id: "validation"
      relationship: implements
    - subsystem_id: "frontmatter"
      relationship: uses
- Validated by `ve chunk validate` to ensure referenced subsystems exist
- When a chunk that implements a subsystem is completed, a reference should be added to
  that chunk in the subsystems OVERVIEW.md file front matter and relevant section.

FRICTION_ENTRIES:
- Optional list of friction entries that this chunk addresses
- Provides "why did we do this work?" traceability from implementation back to accumulated pain points
- Format: entry_id is the friction entry ID (e.g., "F001"), scope is "full" or "partial"
  - "full": This chunk fully resolves the friction entry
  - "partial": This chunk partially addresses the friction entry
- When to populate: During /chunk-create if this chunk addresses known friction from FRICTION.md
- Example:
  friction_entries:
    - entry_id: F001
      scope: full
    - entry_id: F003
      scope: partial
- Validated by `ve chunk validate` to ensure referenced friction entries exist in FRICTION.md
- When a chunk addresses friction entries and is completed, those entries are considered RESOLVED

CHUNK ARTIFACTS:
- Single-use scripts, migration tools, or one-time utilities created for this chunk
  should be stored in the chunk directory (e.g., docs/chunks/foo/migrate.py)
- These artifacts help future archaeologists understand what the chunk did
- Unlike code in src/, chunk artifacts are not expected to be maintained long-term
- Examples: data migration scripts, one-time fixups, analysis tools used during implementation

CREATED_AFTER:
- Auto-populated by `ve chunk create` - DO NOT MODIFY manually
- Lists the "tips" of the chunk DAG at creation time (chunks with no dependents yet)
- Tips must be ACTIVE chunks (shipped work that has been merged)
- Example: created_after: ["auth_refactor", "api_cleanup"]

IMPORTANT - created_after is NOT implementation dependencies:
- created_after tracks CAUSAL ORDERING (what work existed when this chunk was created)
- It does NOT mean "chunks that must be implemented before this one can work"
- FUTURE chunks can NEVER be tips (they haven't shipped yet)

COMMON MISTAKE: Setting created_after to reference FUTURE chunks because they
represent design dependencies. This is WRONG. If chunk B conceptually depends on
chunk A's implementation, but A is still FUTURE, B's created_after should still
reference the current ACTIVE tips, not A.

WHERE TO TRACK IMPLEMENTATION DEPENDENCIES:
- Investigation proposed_chunks ordering (earlier = implement first)
- Narrative chunk sequencing in OVERVIEW.md
- Design documents describing the intended build order
- The `created_after` field will naturally reflect this once chunks ship

DEPENDS_ON:
- Declares explicit implementation dependencies that affect orchestrator scheduling
- Format: list of chunk directory name strings, or null
- Default: [] (empty list - explicitly no dependencies)

VALUE SEMANTICS (how the orchestrator interprets this field):

| Value             | Meaning                              | Oracle behavior   |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------|
| `null` or omitted | "I don't know my dependencies"       | Consult oracle    |
| `[]` (empty list) | "I explicitly have no dependencies"  | Bypass oracle     |
| `["chunk_a"]`     | "I depend on these specific chunks"  | Bypass oracle     |

CRITICAL: The default `[]` means "I have analyzed this chunk and it has no dependencies."
This is an explicit assertion, not a placeholder. If you haven't analyzed dependencies yet,
change the value to `null` (or remove the field entirely) to trigger oracle consultation.

WHEN TO USE EACH VALUE:
- Use `[]` when you have analyzed the chunk and determined it has no implementation dependencies
  on other chunks in the same batch. This tells the orchestrator to skip conflict detection.
- Use `null` when you haven't analyzed dependencies yet and want the orchestrator's conflict
  oracle to determine if this chunk conflicts with others.
- Use `["chunk_a", "chunk_b"]` when you know specific chunks must complete before this one.

WHY THIS MATTERS:
The orchestrator's conflict oracle adds latency and cost to detect potential conflicts.
When you declare `[]`, you're asserting independence and enabling the orchestrator to
schedule immediately. When you declare `null`, you're requesting conflict analysis.

PURPOSE AND BEHAVIOR:
- When a list is provided (empty or not), the orchestrator uses it directly for scheduling
- When null, the orchestrator consults its conflict oracle to detect dependencies heuristically
- Dependencies express order within a single injection batch (intra-batch scheduling)
- The chunks listed in depends_on will be scheduled to complete before this chunk starts

CONTRAST WITH created_after:
- `created_after` tracks CAUSAL ORDERING (what work existed when this chunk was created)
- `depends_on` tracks IMPLEMENTATION DEPENDENCIES (what must complete before this chunk runs)
- `created_after` is auto-populated at creation time and should NOT be modified manually
- `depends_on` is agent-populated based on design requirements and may be edited

WHEN TO DECLARE EXPLICIT DEPENDENCIES:
- When you know chunk B requires chunk A's implementation to exist before B can work
- When the conflict oracle would otherwise miss a subtle dependency
- When you want to enforce a specific execution order within a batch injection
- When a narrative or investigation explicitly defines chunk sequencing

EXAMPLE:
  # Chunk has no dependencies (explicit assertion - bypasses oracle)
  depends_on: []

  # Chunk dependencies unknown (triggers oracle consultation)
  depends_on: null

  # Chunk B depends on chunk A completing first
  depends_on: ["auth_api"]

  # Chunk C depends on both A and B completing first
  depends_on: ["auth_api", "auth_client"]

VALIDATION:
- `null` is valid and triggers oracle consultation
- `[]` is valid and means "explicitly no dependencies" (bypasses oracle)
- Referenced chunks should exist in docs/chunks/ (warning if not found)
- Circular dependencies will be detected at injection time
- Dependencies on ACTIVE chunks are allowed (they've already completed)

# Chunk Goal

## Minor Goal

The wiki-conflict resolver attempts synthesis on every text-content
markdown file in an entity worktree, not just the `wiki/` subtree.
`memories/**.md`, `wiki/**.md`, and any other `.md` path under the entity
root are eligible for LLM synthesis when they have conflict markers.
Only files for which the resolver legitimately cannot help (binary blobs,
non-markdown text formats whose semantics the resolver doesn't model,
or markdown files where synthesis returns content that still contains
markers) are reported as "unresolvable."

The agent SDK invocation that drives the resolver is configured to
actually complete its synthesis in one user turn. The agent is told it
needs no tool use — it has the full file content in the prompt and
returns a complete file body — and `max_turns` is set high enough that a
benign internal step does not exhaust the budget before the assistant
emits its response.

When the resolver fails for a particular file, the failure surfaces to
the operator with a one-line diagnostic that names the cause (agent
returned an error / response was empty / synthesized output still
contains conflict markers / file is binary / etc.). The CLI no longer
catches resolver `RuntimeError` silently. The operator can act on the
information instead of guessing.

In aggregate, the resolver's footprint matches operator expectation: a
trivially-synthesizable conflict (such as a Markdown table where each
side advanced different rows) gets auto-resolved on the first run, and
when the resolver legitimately can't help the operator sees why.

## Success Criteria

- The eligibility check in `merge_entity` (currently
  `is_wiki = filepath.startswith("wiki/") and filepath.endswith(".md")`)
  is broadened to "any `.md` file under the entity root that isn't a
  binary or otherwise excluded path." `memories/**.md` (including
  `memories/.snapshot_pre_consolidation/**.md` if those files are
  tracked) flow through the resolver.
- The resolver's agent SDK options give the synthesis enough budget to
  complete. `max_turns` is raised (or replaced with a turn budget that
  reflects the actual single-prompt-single-response shape of the call),
  and the prompt explicitly states no tool use is needed and the entire
  file body is in the prompt.
- The resolver verifies its own output: if the synthesized content still
  contains `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, or `>>>>>>>` markers, the resolver
  treats this as a synthesis failure (not a success) and the file ends
  up in the unresolvable list with a "synthesis incomplete" diagnostic.
- `merge_entity`'s `except RuntimeError` block in the resolver-call site
  records the underlying error message and surfaces it through the
  `MergeConflictsPending` result. The CLI's "could not be auto-resolved"
  message includes a one-line cause per file.
- A merge of two divergent entity histories whose conflicts include
  table-style content under `wiki/projects/*.md` and Markdown content
  under `memories/**.md` produces a successful auto-resolution for
  cleanly-mergeable conflicts on the first `ve entity pull`. The
  operator-reported case (cc3148_audit table-row union, plus the
  matching memories pages) is the regression test.
- Tests cover: non-`wiki/` markdown is attempted; agent error surfaces
  to the operator; synthesized output containing markers is rejected;
  table-row union case auto-resolves.

## Out of Scope

- Re-architecting the resolver's prompt or synthesis strategy.
- Resolving conflicts in non-markdown text files (JSON, YAML, source
  code). The expansion stays inside markdown for this chunk.
- Auto-resolving conflicts the resolver legitimately can't synthesize.
  When the resolver gives up, it gives up loudly — that's the success
  state.
