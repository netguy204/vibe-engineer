1. Create a short name handle that describes this concept. A short name should
   be 32 characters or less and words should be underscore separated. We will
   refer to this shortname later as <shortname>.

2. Run `ve narrative create <shortname>` and note the created directory name. We
   will refer to this name later as <narrative_directory>.

3. Complete the template in <narrative_directory>/OVERVIEW.md with the

   interactions with the operator.
