description: Implement the active chunk.

## Tips

- The ve command is an installed CLI tool, not a file in the repository. Do not
search for it - run it directly via Bash.

## Instructions

1. Determine the currently active chunk by running `ve chunk list --latest`. We
   will refer to the directory returned by this command below as <chunk
   directory>

2. Implement the chunk plan as described in <chunk directory>/PLAN.md
