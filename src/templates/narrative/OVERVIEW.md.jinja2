STATUS VALUES:
- DRAFTING: The narrative is being refined; chunks not yet created
- ACTIVE: Chunks are being created and implemented from this narrative
- COMPLETED: All chunks have been created and the narrative's ambition is realized

ADVANCES_TRUNK_GOAL:
- Reference the specific section of docs/trunk/GOAL.md this narrative advances
- Example: "Required Properties: Must support multi-repository workflows"

PROPOSED_CHUNKS:
- Starts empty; entries are added as prompts are turned into chunks via /chunk-create
- Each entry records which prompt was refined and where the resulting chunk lives
- prompt: The prompt text from this document that was used to create the chunk
- chunk_directory: The created chunk directory (e.g., "0007-feature_name"), null until created
- DO NOT POPULATE this array during narrative creation. It will be populated as
  chunks are created.
- Use `ve chunk list-proposed` to see all proposed chunks that haven't been created yet

## Advances Trunk Goal

<!--
Which section of docs/trunk/GOAL.md does this narrative advance?
Be specific - reference the section name and summarize the relevant content.

Example: "Required Properties: Must support multi-repository workflows"

If no existing section applies to this narrative, STOP. This is a signal that
trunk GOAL.md has a gap. Work with the operator to expand trunk GOAL.md first,
then return here and complete this reference.

A narrative without a clear trunk GOAL anchor risks drift and scope creep.
-->

## Driving Ambition

<!--
Describe what you're trying to achieve in natural language. Write as if you're
explaining the goal to a colleague - what's the high-level objective? Why does
it matter? What does success look like at a high level?

This doesn't need to be polished. A rough description is a good starting point.
Through dialogue with the agent, we'll refine this ambition into concrete chunks.

Example:
"I want to support multi-repository workflows so that teams can manage related
projects together. Right now each repo is isolated, which creates friction
when changes span multiple codebases. Success means an operator can define
relationships between repos and the tooling respects those relationships
during chunk creation and completion."
-->

## Chunks

<!--
REFINEMENT GUIDANCE FOR AGENTS:

Before populating this section, help the operator decompose their ambition.
Consider asking:

- What's the first concrete step toward this ambition?
- Are there dependencies between the pieces of work, or could they happen in
  any order?
- What's the smallest useful increment that delivers value?
- Is any piece of this too large to be a single chunk? (A chunk should be
  completable in a focused session.)
- What would need to be true before you'd consider this narrative complete?

Each chunk prompt should be a sentence or two - enough to seed the /chunk-create
process, which handles detailed refinement.
-->

<!--
Update the proposed_chunks array in the frontmatter as prompts are defined.
The list below mirrors the frontmatter for readability.

1. _Chunk prompt will appear here after refinement_

## Completion Criteria

<!--
How will you know this narrative is done? This isn't about individual chunk
success (each chunk has its own criteria) - it's about the narrative as a whole.

When all chunks are complete, what can the user do that they couldn't do before?
Focus on user outcomes - the operator and agent are means to deliver value to
the user.

Example:
"When complete, a user can manage related projects as a unified workspace,
with changes that span repositories tracked and deployed together."
