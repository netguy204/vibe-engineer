# Friction Log

<!--
GUIDANCE FOR AGENTS:

When appending a new friction entry:
1. Read existing themes - cluster the new entry into an existing theme if it fits
2. If no theme fits, add a new theme to frontmatter
3. Assign the next sequential F-number ID
4. Use the format: ### FXXX: YYYY-MM-DD [theme-id] Title

Entry status is DERIVED, not stored:
- OPEN: Entry ID not in any proposed_chunks.addresses
- ADDRESSED: Entry ID in proposed_chunks.addresses where chunk_directory is set
- RESOLVED: Entry ID addressed by a chunk that has reached COMPLETE status

When patterns emerge (3+ entries in a theme, or recurring pain):
- Add a proposed_chunk to frontmatter with the entry IDs it would address
- The prompt should describe the work, not just "fix friction"
