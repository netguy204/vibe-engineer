## Instructions

The operator wants to collaboratively develop this concept with you:

$ARGUMENTS

---

1. Create a short name handle that describes this concept. A short name should
   be 32 characters or less and words should be underscore separated. We will
   refer to this shortname later as <shortname>.

2. Run `ve narrative create <shortname>` and note the created path. The narrative
   will be created in `docs/narratives/`. Example output:
   ```
   Created docs/narratives/<shortname>
   ```
   We will refer to this path later as <narrative_path>.

3. Complete the template in <narrative_path>/OVERVIEW.md with the
   information supplied by the operator and through further clarification
   interactions with the operator.
