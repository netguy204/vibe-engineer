description: Create a new chunk of work and refine its goal.

## Instructions

The operator wants to define a piece of work to do the following:

$ARGUMENTS

---

You will help them achieve this by following these steps carefully and
completely in order:

1. Determine a short name for this work. A short name must be less than 32
   characters long. Its words are underscore separated and it is intended to
   provide a terse handle for thinking about what the work represents.
   Substitute this shortname below for the <shortname> placeholder.

2. And if the operator has referenced a ticket number, extract it and supply it to
   the command below where the placeholder <ticket number> is referenced. If no
   ticket number is referenced, pass no argument to the command below in the
   <ticket number> placeholder.

3. **Determine whether to create a FUTURE chunk.** Run `ve chunk list --latest`
   to check if there's already an IMPLEMENTING chunk:

   - If there IS an IMPLEMENTING chunk, default to using `--future` when creating
     this new chunk. Only skip `--future` if the user explicitly indicates they
     want to work on this immediately instead of the current chunk.

   - If there is NO IMPLEMENTING chunk (command exits with error or returns nothing),
     create the chunk normally without `--future`.

   - Also analyze the user's prompt for signals like "later", "next", "after this",
     "future", "queue up" - these all suggest using `--future`.

4. Run `ve chunk start <shortname> <ticket number> [--future]` and note the chunk
   directory name that is returned by the command. Include `--future` based on
   the determination in step 3. Substitute this name below for the <chunk
   directory> placeholder.

5. Refine the contents of <chunk directory>/GOAL.md given the piece of work that
   the user has described, ask them any questions required to complete the
   template and cohesively and thoroughly define the goal of what they're trying
   to accomplish.

**Note on FUTURE chunks:** A FUTURE chunk is queued for later work. When the user
is ready to start working on it, they can run `ve chunk activate <chunk_id>` to
change its status from FUTURE to IMPLEMENTING. Only one chunk can be IMPLEMENTING
at a time.
