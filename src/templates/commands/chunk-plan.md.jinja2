description: Create a chunk PLAN.md file containing the technical breakdown for the work in that chunk's GOAL.md file.

{% set source_template = "chunk-plan.md.jinja2" %}
{% include "partials/auto-generated-header.md.jinja2" %}
## Tips

{% include "partials/common-tips.md.jinja2" %}
{% if task_context %}

**Task Context:** The PLAN.md is created in the external artifact repo
(`{{ external_artifact_repo }}`). When planning, consider how implementation
will span participating projects and reference their structures appropriately.

## Instructions

1. Determine the currently active chunk by running `ve chunk list --latest`. We
   will refer to the directory returned by this command below as <chunk
   directory>

{# Chunk: docs/chunks/restore_template_content - Cluster prefix suggestion step #}
{# Chunk: docs/chunks/cluster_subsystem_prompt - Subsystem documentation guidance #}
2. Run `ve chunk suggest-prefix <chunk_name>` (using just the directory name,
   not the full path) to check if this chunk should be renamed for better
   semantic clustering. If a prefix is suggested:
   - Present the suggestion to the operator: "This chunk is similar to
     `{prefix}_*` chunks. Consider renaming to `{prefix}_{current_name}`?"
   - If the operator accepts, use `mv` to rename the chunk directory
   - Update <chunk directory> to the new path before continuing
   - **After any rename:** Run `ve chunk cluster-list` to see how large the
     new cluster is. If it has 5+ chunks with no subsystem documentation,
     suggest the operator consider `/subsystem-discover` to capture invariants

3. Study <chunk directory>/GOAL.md

4. In light of the broader project objective in docs/trunk/GOAL.md and the
   guiding architecture decisions in docs/trunk/DECISIONS.md and the existing
   codebase: Complete the template in <chunk directory>/PLAN.md with a detailed
   sequence of steps that will achieve the goal. If a chunk is part of a
   narrative (docs/narratives/[goal.frontmatter.narrative]/OVERVIEW.md), it may
   be valuable to read about the broader picture that the goal fits into.
