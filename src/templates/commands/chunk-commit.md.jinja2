description: Create a git commit
---

## Context

- Current git status: !`git status`
- Current git diff (staged and unstaged changes): !`git diff HEAD`
- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Recent commits: !`git log --oneline -10`
- Current chunk: !`ve chunk list --latest 2>/dev/null || ve chunk list --last-active 2>/dev/null || echo "(no active chunk)"`

## Your task

Based on the above changes, create a single git commit. Use the conventional commit message format.

### What to ALWAYS include

These files are primary work artifacts and MUST be committed:

1. **Chunk documentation** (`docs/chunks/<chunk_name>/`):
   - `GOAL.md` - Including status updates (FUTURE → IMPLEMENTING → ACTIVE)
   - `PLAN.md` - The implementation plan with any deviations noted
   - Any chunk artifacts (scripts, analysis tools) in the chunk directory

2. **Source code changes** (`src/`, `tests/`, etc.):
   - Implementation code
   - Test files
   - Configuration changes

3. **Project documentation updates**:
   - Changes to `docs/trunk/` files (DECISIONS.md, SPEC.md, etc.)
   - Updates to subsystems, narratives, or investigations

### What to EXCLUDE

Do not commit these ephemeral files:

- Build artifacts and compiled binaries
- IDE/editor configuration files (`.idea/`, `.vscode/` unless project-wide)
- Temporary files, logs, or cache directories
- Files in `.ve/` (orchestrator runtime state)
- Personal notes or scratch files not in the chunk directory

### Commit message format

Use conventional commits. The message should describe what was accomplished, not just list files changed. Include the chunk context when relevant.

Example:
```
feat: add user authentication middleware

Implement JWT-based auth for API endpoints with refresh token support.
Update chunk status to ACTIVE with code references.
