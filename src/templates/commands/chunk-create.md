Create a new chunk of work and refine its goal. 

The operator wants to define a piece of work to do the following:

$ARGUMENTS

---

You will help them achieve this by following these steps carefully and
completely in order:

1. Determine a short name for this work. A short name must be less than 32
   characters long. Its words are underscore separated and it is intended to
   provide a terse handle for thinking about what the work represents.
   Substitute this shortname below for the <shortname> placeholder.

2. And if the operator has referenced a ticket number, extract it and supply it to
   the command below where the placeholder <ticket number> is referenced. If no
   ticket number is referenced, pass no argument to the command below in the
   <ticket number> placeholder.

3. Run `ve chunk start <shortname> <ticket number>` and note the chunk
   directory name that is returned by the command.  Substitute this name below
   for the <chunk directory> placeholder.

4. Refine the contents of <chunk directory>/GOAL.md given the piece of work that
   the user has described, ask them any questions required to complete the
   template and cohesively and thoroughly define the goal of what they're trying
   to accomplish.
