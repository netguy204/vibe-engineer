## Tips

{% include "partials/common-tips.md.jinja2" %}
{% if task_context %}

**Task Context:** Implementation may span multiple participating projects:
{% for project in projects %}
- `{{ project }}`
{% endfor %}

The chunk plan is in the external repo (`{{ external_artifact_repo }}`). Work
from the task root to access both the plan and all project directories.
{% endif %}

## Instructions

1. Determine the currently active chunk by running `ve chunk list --latest`. We
   will refer to the directory returned by this command below as <chunk
   directory>

2. Implement the chunk plan as described in <chunk directory>/PLAN.md

3. When implementation is complete, STOP. Do NOT:
   - Modify the chunk GOAL.md status field
   - Run chunk-complete or any finalization steps
   - Set status to ACTIVE or any other value

   A separate COMPLETE phase handles status transitions and finalization.
