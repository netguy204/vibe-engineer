# Project Goal

<!--
This document is the stable anchor for the entire project. It should rarely change.
If you find yourself wanting to modify this frequently, you may have started
building before the problem was well understood.

Write in terms of WHAT and WHY, not HOW. The how belongs in SPEC.md and in chunks.
-->

## Problem Statement

<!--
What problem does this project solve? Who experiences this problem?
Be specific enough that someone could determine whether a given solution
actually addresses the problem.
-->

## Required Properties

<!--
What properties MUST the solution have to be considered successful?
These are non-negotiable. Examples:
- "Must handle 10K messages/second sustained throughput"
- "Must survive process crash without data loss"
- "Must run without external dependencies"

Be precise. "Fast" is not a property. "P99 latency under 5ms" is.
-->

## Constraints

<!--
What limitations exist on the solution space? These might be:
- Technical: must run on Linux, must use less than 100MB memory
- Organizational: must be maintainable by a small team, must not require ops expertise
- Timeline: must be usable for X by Y date

Constraints help rule out solutions that might otherwise seem attractive.
-->

## Out of Scope

<!--
What are you explicitly NOT trying to solve? This prevents scope creep
and helps others understand the boundaries of the project.

Being explicit about non-goals is as important as being explicit about goals.
-->

## Success Criteria

<!--
How will you know when the project has achieved its goal?
These should be concrete and verifiable, tied to the Required Properties above.
