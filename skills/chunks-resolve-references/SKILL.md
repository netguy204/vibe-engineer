name: chunks-resolve-references
description: Update code references across all ACTIVE chunks in parallel and resolve or notify the operator about ambiguities. Use when the operator asks to refresh references project-wide, or after large refactors that may have invalidated chunk code references.
allowed-tools: Bash(ve --help:*), Bash(cat:*), Bash(grep:*), Bash(ve hooks show:*)

## Context

- ve CLI: !`ve --help >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo "installed" || echo "(ve CLI not found)"`
- Task workspace: !`cat .ve-task.yaml 2>/dev/null || cat ../.ve-task.yaml 2>/dev/null || echo "(not a task workspace)"`
- Project config: !`cat .ve-config.yaml 2>/dev/null || echo "(no .ve-config.yaml — defaults apply)"`
- Project hook: !`ve hooks show chunks-resolve-references 2>/dev/null || echo "(no project hook)"`

## Runtime context

Interpret the context above before following the instructions:

- **ve CLI**: The `ve` command is an installed CLI tool, not a file in the
  repository. Do not search for it — run it directly via Bash. If the
  context shows "(ve CLI not found)", tell the operator that the
  vibe-engineer plugin requires the separately installed `ve` CLI, suggest
  `uv tool install vibe-engineer` (or `pip install vibe-engineer`), and
  stop.
- **Uninitialized project**: If `ve` is installed but commands fail because
  there is no `docs/chunks/` structure, tell the operator to run `ve init`
  in the project root, then stop.
- **Task workspace**: If the Task workspace context shows YAML (keys
  `external_artifact_repo` and `projects`) instead of "(not a task
  workspace)", you are in a multi-project task workspace. Artifacts
  (chunks, narratives, investigations) live in the external artifact repo
  named by `external_artifact_repo`; code changes happen in the
  participating `projects`. Command-specific task guidance appears below.
- **Project config**: `.ve-config.yaml` holds project configuration.
  Known keys: `cluster_subsystem_threshold` (default 5 — the cluster size
  at which to suggest subsystem documentation). When the context shows
  "(no .ve-config.yaml — defaults apply)", use the defaults.
- **Project hook**: `docs/hooks/chunks-resolve-references.md` holds this repository's
  own requirements for this command. When the context shows hook content,
  treat it as a binding instruction from the operator: satisfy it before
  reporting this command complete, and say so when you do. When it shows
  "(no project hook)", there are none. If a hook contradicts this command's
  own instructions, do not silently choose — surface the conflict to the
  operator and ask.

## Instructions

1. Identify all active chunks with `grep -l "status: ACTIVE" docs/chunks/*/GOAL.md`

2. In parallel sub-agents run `/chunk-update-references <path to goal>` for
   each of the directories containing active GOALs
